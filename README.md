## the first app

Swift is cool.
a bootstrap app programmatic ,without any StoryBoard

## app ui

one view controller 
inside it : a button titled as "INC"
a label texted as "0"
when INC button clicked , label text count increment 1.

figure as !(oneplus figure)[oneplus.jpg] 

## execise points

1. root view controller 
2. view ,rootViewController.view,button as a view ,label as a view
3. add sub view by view.addSubView
4. make event to function by view.addTarget
5. Selector vs. #selector

## swift is cool

- like any other modern language such as  c# or java
- ctor ,no required new keyword
- i like literal syntax very much

## no storyboard 

- like PS
- spend too much statements to introduce a simple thing
